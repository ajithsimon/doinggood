                    <h3> About Us:</h3>

                    <p>DoingGood is a community of charitable people that get fulfillment by offering their time,
                        talents, Goods and resources for the benefit of their chosen cause.</p>

                    <p>Charitable organizations are built to support their underlying cause. They rely heavily on
                        volunteers and donors to keep the spirit of their mission alive. At times the daunting task of
                        asking people for more and more weighs heavily upon some organizations. However, most
                        people truly want to help these organizations, but they just don’t know how. DoingGood
                        was developed as an alternative fundraising solution for Organizations that is different from
                        the traditional mailing list and volunteer sign up sheet. DoingGood broadens an Organization’s
                        volunteer base and funding source by offering non-traditional opportunities to volunteers.</p>

                    <p>DoingGood will assist organizations in finding their supporters by easily connecting those that
                        have something to offer with those that are looking for help.</p>

                    <p>Our DoingGood platform provides everyday people the opportunity to make a difference.
                        People volunteer for many reasons. Maybe you want to give back to something that has done
                        good for you. Maybe you’re teaching your children moral duty and instilling that it is the “right
                        thing to do”. No matter why you volunteer, you can’t deny that high you feel from doing good
                        for others. DoingGood is the perfect place to go for people that don’t always know what to do,
                        or how they can make a difference.</p>

                    <p class="fw-600">Join DoingGood for your opportunity to get that feeling of satisfaction.</p>
